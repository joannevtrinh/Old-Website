 	 <h2> User Research </h2>

 	 <div class = "uInterview">
 	 <h6>User Interviews</h6>
 	 <p>It is important to conduct user interviews because we want to see how our peers and people who've worked in the same industry feel and expect about a certain websites. Because we're all in a similar field of study, we can relate to each other's struggles and what we have to overcome in order to properly execute what makes a good website. That way, the site we build can reach an expected standard and an general understanding of what it took to make it. Not only will we reach better outcomes of a website, but we could also obtain valuable insight to what they expect a modern responsive website to be.  

 	 The questions mainly asked about each interviewee are about their career, goals, current struggles, how they feel maintaining an online portfolio/website of their own, and seeing other's online portfolio/website.</p>

 	 </div>

 	 <div class = "cAnalysis">
 	 <h6>Competitor Analysis</h6>
 	 <p>A competitor analysis is an in-depth look at other websites/portfolios similar to ours. We examine the strengths, weaknesses, the good and the bad; the nitty-gritty of other's products. Because of examination, we try to take what works for other's website (and avoid the bad), use it as a guideline, and try to make the best of what it could be for our site. 

 	 The competitors I reviewed were people of notable website/portfolio designs, people who have been coding and making their own website designs for a very long time. I choose them because I wanted my own portfolio to someday reach that level of amazing design and reach industry standards.

 	 <h6>Feature Value Matrix</h6>
 	 <p>A feature value matrix is a an outline of all the features within a website/product. It highlights the features importance, value to the company and users, and developer effort. It connects an ideal company team by listing out what the user's want, what the developer can ideally do, and how much a company can benefit from the features.

 	 I selected my features based on what my website offers to users, how much it took to build as the developer, and how a company would value it. Each feature has to do with something that made my website come alive as it is.

 	 </div>

 	 <div class = "fp">
 	 <h6>Feature Prioritization</h6>
 	 <p> I prioritized my features based on the feature value matrix outcomes. The higher the total was, the higher priority it had to make it better. 

 	 It can be incorporated into building an interface because it gives a visual to the developers and company members for what to build and redesign first. It makes it clear to what feature is valuable to it's users and what matters to them. It also shows what feature might not be valuable to the company if it turns out to be not as far up and beneficial on the charts.

 	 <h2>User Testing</h2>

 	 <div class = "uStories">
 	 <h6>User Stories</h6>
 	 <p>User Stories are valuable because it allows the developer to place themselves in the different perspectives of the audience who would be visiting their website/product. It focuses in on each different feature, it's intent, and what it should do considering who is using the website.

 	 I created my user stories based on the features I had on my website and asked what they should be doing. I wanted my features to not only serve the users who visited my website, but to also make sure my intentions were clear. User Stories made sure that my features really did what they're suppose to do.

 	 </div>

 	 <div class = "cWalk">
 	 <h6>Cognitive Walkthrough</h6>
 	 <p>A cognitive walkthrough is an in-person tutorial of how a user uses your website/product. As the person conducting the walkthrough, we want to see how the user interacts with the website and their impressions of it. We can closely watch the person interacting with the website and truly see how it feels in other's eyes. It's important because we can see in person the good and the bad of our website through someone else's experience. It gets to the heart of the problems of the website and exposes flaws we may have not seen before.

 	 It was challenging to ask the appropriate questions in this walkthrough. My website was very simple and straight to the point, so it felt too straight forward that my interviewees shouldn't be lost. I had to conduct my walkthrough as a mixture of asking what was good, what stood out, if something was easy or hard to find, and how the layout felt.

 	 </div>

 	 <div class = "uTest">
 	 <h6>User Test</h6>
 	 <p>I used a 5 second test and a questions test as apart of my user test. I used these tests because I knew that I was lacking in major parts of my design but wasn't totally sure of what or how to improve of them. So I targetted my testers with these tests trying to get feedback. 

 	 There were some major challenges to this because it was really hard to find people to test the site. Either people were busy, didn't bother to do it, or gave some really unhelpful feedback. But the feedback that I got did say a lot about the parts of design which I thought were lacking. I got a mixed response about my navigation, layout, and design, which says a lot that I have to do to in order to get a better majority response.

 	 <div class = "summaryF">
 	 <h6>Summary of Findings</h6>
 	 <p>Throughout the testing process and gathering research, I've found that the problems I had guessed would be major turned out to be right. My testers were very confused about the layout of my website, as they found it messy and disorganized. The navigation felt awkward to my testers as they weren't appealed by it's designed and how it was listed out like a bunch of links. My navigation wasn't decorative or seemed like an actual menu. It was also in an awkward position compared to the content of the site and could be designed way better. I had first imagined that my background was a really cool design, but because of the feedback, it turned out to be more distracting than it was appealing. The overall layout of each element was strange and clashed against each other; it needed some massive improvement. One comment I actually had was that it felt like a MySpace website, which is an insult. There was also a problem which I had placed my contact info and things about me in a strange manner. When I researched other competitor sites, I realized that most websites compiled info and their contact info all into one page and that it was probably best I do that too if I wanted employers to look at my site.
 	 </p>

 	 <p>
 	 There was a part in my test where I asked my testers if they understood the intent of my website, to which, a some of them weren't sure that it was suppose to be a portfolio and resume website. I got a mix of responses asking if it was a bio of myself or if it was resume. Another question I asked was what was the least appealing and what stood out the most out of all the features of the website and most of the responses said my background. Another important finding that stood out to me was whether or not I had enough content on the website. And to most of my testers, they found that the content was indeed lacking and wasn't substantial. They also said that the pictures of myself were placed strangley as it was below my bio. 
 	 </p>

 	 <p>
 	 Through the findings and research, I've confirmed and concluded that there are many problems to do with the layout of the elements, the background, the navigation menu, and the overall content from the website. What I initially created and thought that it was cool for a first time creation, actually turned out to be quite the opposite. As I conducted the tests and researched other sites like mine, I realized how much better it could improve and that the ideas I had in the beginning needed very dramatic changes.

 	 <div class = "iFindings">
 	 <h2>Incorportation of Findings</h2>
 	 <p>To start off, I really wanted the background I initially had to work out somehow (the artwork is really cool). But based on the feedback I got, everyone thought it was more distracting. So I had to think of I could still incorporate it but not make it as blaring. As a solution, I made it so that it only appeared on my homepage and in a smaller section. That way, my site felt less MySpace-like and up to industry standards. It also felt less daunting and blinding to my users. As for the rest of the background, I gave it a light blue background with some purple accents, so that it was easy on the eyes and consistent through all my pages. As for the navigation, I ended up making it so that it wasn't hanging on the side like a list of links. I restructed it so that it was on the very top of each page and that it wasn't just some link, but a decent menu. I made sure to restruct the layout of each element so that it was more appealing as the user's eyes went from top to bottom of the page. The navigation moved to the very top, the content below, and information about me stayed on one page. I also placed the pictues of myself in the homepage of my site because I wanted to make it clear who this site belonged to. I changed it so that it was next to my name. I also made sure to include that this site was a portfolio and resume of myself, as my users had trouble figuring out what the intent of the site was for. 
 	 </p>
 	 <p>
 	 As for the changes that I haven't completely figured out, it would be mainly about the content of the site. As of right now, I don't have that much on my resume nor do I have many projects that I could brag about. I'm also still debating what the best way it is to present my resume. Since it is a bunch of words, I figured anything distracting wouldn't be the best. But it looks too little with just it's text. I plan to add more into the resume page, but it would definitely be a minimal decoration. This problem would also apply to my contact's page, as it looks very plain and simple. I plan to add more into to it to make it more decorative. Though based on research, it seems a lot of web developers have added forms onto their contact page, which I'll try to do later on. I would also like to, in the future, be able to make the pictures and buttons have animated effects. I believe that way, it's more interactive with the user and also makes it more fun. I hope that I could really work on this project after this class is over.s
